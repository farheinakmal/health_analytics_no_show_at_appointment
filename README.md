# health_analytics_no_show_at_appointment
The data was taken from the website Kaggle . The data set included 110527 records which is relevant to healthcare operations. After examining the dataset, I realized my interest towards health policies. The relationship between medical institutions and common people is an interesting topic to study and analyses. The data which was collected has a lot of errors which is very common in the real world and has its own value to do its examination. The aim of the analysis is to examine the pattern by number of patients who skipped their appointment and see if it is possible to predict if a patient will show up for the appointment or not.
